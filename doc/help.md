### Get **Evernote** Developer Token

**EverMarkEditor** needs a **Evernote** Developer Token to access your account.

So you need to create a **Evernote** Developer Token.

You can refer to [**Evernote** Developer Token page](https://dev.evernote.com/doc/articles/dev_tokens.php) to get a full understand of  **Evernote** Developer Token.

Or you can just go to [Create **Evernote** Developer Token](https://www.evernote.com/api/DeveloperToken.action) or [创建印象笔记Developer Token](https://app.yinxiang.com/api/DeveloperToken.action) if you are user of **印象笔记** , then click ***Create a developer token*** to create your developer token.

Copy the Developer Token after you have created it, and save it carefully(anyone have this token can access your notes in **Evernote** !) .
